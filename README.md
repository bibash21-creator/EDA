📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Loan Data

This repository contains a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project focused on examining and understanding loan data. The goal of this project is to explore data patterns, perform hypothesis testing, and visualize meaningful insights that can help in understanding borrower behavior and loan characteristics.

🚀 Features

📂 Data Loading & Initial Exploration — Import, inspect, and summarize the dataset for better understanding

🧠 Hypothesis Testing — Validate assumptions and relationships within the loan data

📈 Statistical Analysis — Perform data-driven exploration of loan parameters and distributions

🎨 Data Visualization — Create visual insights using charts and graphs for trend discovery

🛠️ Technology Stack

Python — Core language for analysis

Jupyter Notebook — Interactive environment for EDA

Libraries Used:

pandas — Data manipulation and cleaning

numpy — Numerical computation

matplotlib / seaborn — Visualization and plotting
